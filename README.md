# TWG---HoloLens-Application

The Walkable Graph (TWG) is an Augmented Reality (AR) application, that uses XML documents to automatically create AR content in form of walkable graphs in an AR environment.
Details about the kind of content processed and how the graphs are computed, can be read in my [Bachelor Thesis](https://github.com/BrendonSutaj/BachelorThesis) in more detail.
